## ⚙️ Configuration Needed

### Backend API Integration

The authentication is ready but needs backend integration:

1. **Update API Endpoint** in `src/app/services/auth.service.ts`:
```typescript
private apiUrl = 'http://localhost:8080/auth'; // Change to your API URL
```

2. **Backend Requirements:**
Your backend should have these endpoints:

```
POST /auth/login
Body: { email: string, password: string }
Response: { user: {...}, token: string }

POST /auth/register
Body: { name, email, phoneNumber, password, sex, birthday, addressId }
Response: { user: {...}, token: string }
```

3. **JWT Token:**
- Backend should return JWT token on successful login/register
- Token is automatically included in all HTTP requests via interceptor
- Token stored in localStorage as 'token'
- User data stored in localStorage as 'currentUser'

### User Roles

For admin access, the user object should have:
```typescript
{
  id: number,
  name: string,
  email: string,
  role: 'admin' // This field determines admin access
}
```
